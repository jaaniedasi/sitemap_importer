# Introduction

If we use Burp Community version. Then we don't have the ability to persist our project. One thing I want to persist is items in Sitemap. Burp Suite provides an option to export sitemap items at `Target` > `Site map` > `right-click on an item below` > `Save selected items`. But it doesn't have option to import back in.

This Burp extension solves this problem

# Installation

This now depends on xercesImpl.jar. For it to work, find the `BurpSuiteCommunity` shell script and using the `add_class_path`, add the jar to the path, like this:
```
local_classpath=""
i4j_classpath="$app_home/.install4j/i4jruntime.jar:$app_home/.install4j/launcher5925f5b4.jar"
add_class_path "$i4j_classpath"
add_class_path "$app_home/burpsuite_community.jar"
add_class_path "/path/to/xercesImpl.jar"
```

1. Download/Clone this source to your computer.
2. In your Burp, go to `Extender` tab > `Options` > `Python Environment` and locate `jython-standalone-2.7.2.jar` location
3. In your Burp, go to `Extender` tab > `Extensions` > `Burp Extensions` > `Add` > Choose Python in `Extension type` and locate `main.py` location

Note: After step 3, you see a message `no sitemap xml file found in {path}`. That's because this extension run on load. So when we want to run this extension, just reload it.

# How to use

- Put sitemap file that you want to import into `source_sitemap` folder. It has to end with ".xml"
- To trigger import action, Go to `Extender` > `Extensions` > uncheck and recheck `Sitemap Importer` again
